# Hexis
Hexis is a game about fitting falling blocks together to clear completed lines.
It's made completely in assembly for the GNU Assembler included in devkitARM.

To compile a ROM file you can use the included Makefile:

    make

You can then run the generated gba file on an emulator or even on real hardware!
